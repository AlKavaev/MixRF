### A random-forest-based approach for imputing clustered incomplete data

This package offers random-forest-based functions to impute clustered incomplete data. The package is tailored for but not limited to imputing multitissue expression data, in which a gene's expression is measured on the collected tissues of an individual but missing on the uncollected tissues.

### Installation
